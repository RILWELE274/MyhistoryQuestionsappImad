Report: History Flashcard App – Kotlin Android Project 
 
 
 
Purpose of the App 
 
The History Flashcard App is a native Android application built using Kotlin in Android Studio. It is designed to help users learn and test their knowledge of historical facts through a simple true/false quiz format. The app loops through five history-based flashcards, records the user's answers, and provides immediate feedback, a score, and personalized end-of-quiz feedback. 
 
 
Design Considerations 
 
The app consists of four key screens: 
 
MainActivity: The welcome screen displaying a brief introduction and a "Start" button to begin the quiz. 
Question Activity: Displays flashcard questions, allows the user to choose between "True" or "False," provides instant feedback, and moves to the next question. 
Scores Activity: Shows the user’s final score, gives motivational feedback based on performance, and offers options to review or exit the app. 
Reviews Activity: Lists all five questions and their correct answers for the user to review and reinforce learning​ (Android x kotlin Beginner Tutorial, 2021)​. 
 
The user interface (UI) is designed for clarity and simplicity. Buttons are clearly labeled, feedback is immediate, and navigation flows smoothly from one screen to the next. All logic, including looping through questions, score calculation, and conditional feedback, is implemented using Kotlin programming best practices. 
 
 
Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions 
 
The entire project is maintained in a GitHub repository for version control. Each meaningful change has been committed with descriptive messages, enabling clear tracking of development progress. GitHub Actions has been configured to automatically run checks and build the app when changes are pushed. This automation ensures code integrity and supports continuous integration principles. 
 
Key GitHub Features Used: 
 
* Source code hosting 
* Commit history tracking 
* GitHub Actions for automated builds 
* README for documentation 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
This project demonstrates the application of core Android development skills, including UI design, control structures, parallel arrays, and conditionals in Kotlin. By integrating GitHub and GitHub Actions, the development process follows modern software engineering practices. The app is educational, interactive, and fulfills all assignment criteria effectively ​(Google developer training team, 2018)​
